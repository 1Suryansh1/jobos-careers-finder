# Fetch API Reference

> Complete reference for the Fetch API endpoint

## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.fetch.tinyfish.ai
```

All requests require an `X-API-Key` header. See [Authentication](/authentication).

***

## Request

```json theme={null}
{
  "urls": ["https://example.com"],
  "format": "html",
  "links": false,
  "image_links": false,
  "ttl": 3600,
  "per_url_timeout_ms": 45000
}
```

### Parameters

<ParamField body="urls" type="string[]" required>
  URLs to fetch and extract. Maximum 10 URLs per request.

  All URLs must use `http` or `https`. Private IP addresses, localhost, and cloud metadata endpoints are rejected.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="purpose" type="string">
  An optional short statement of **why** you are fetching these URLs — the underlying goal or task
  the content will be used for. Supplying the intent behind a fetch gives us additional signal to
  further inform and deliver better-quality results. When omitted, fetch behaves exactly as before.
  When supplied, the value must be non-empty (whitespace-only values are rejected). Maximum 2000
  characters. For example, `Compare pricing tiers across vendors for a procurement report`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="format" type="string" default="markdown">
  Output format for the `text` field in each result. One of:

  * `html` — semantic HTML
  * `markdown` — clean Markdown, recommended for LLMs (default)
  * `json` — structured document tree
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="links" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, include all `<a href>` URLs found on the page in the `links` field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="image_links" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, include all `<img src>` URLs found on the page in the `image_links` field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="iframe_links" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, include the `src` URLs of `<iframe>` elements found on the page in the `iframe_links` field.

  Use this when a page embeds its main content in a frame (job boards, booking widgets, document viewers): fetch the returned URL to read the embedded content. Iframes that a page injects with JavaScript are only present when the page was rendered in a browser.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ttl" type="integer" default="omitted">
  Cache freshness tolerance in seconds.

  * Omit `ttl` to accept any cached entry.
  * Set `ttl` to `0` when you want a live fetch.
  * Set `ttl` to a positive integer to accept cached entries younger than that many seconds.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="per_url_timeout_ms" type="integer" default="omitted">
  Per-URL wall-clock timeout budget in milliseconds. Must be between `1` and `110000`.

  If a URL exceeds this budget, that URL returns a `timeout` error in `errors[]` while other URLs in the same request can still complete.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="if_none_match" type="string">
  An ETag you saved from a prior fetch of this URL, forwarded verbatim as the `If-None-Match` header on the origin request. Single URL only — combining with a batch of URLs returns a `400`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="if_modified_since" type="string">
  A `Last-Modified` value you saved from a prior fetch of this URL, forwarded verbatim as the `If-Modified-Since` header on the origin request. Single URL only — combining with a batch of URLs returns a `400`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="include_etag_and_last_modified" type="boolean" default="false">
  When `true`, include `etag` and `last_modified` on each result so you can store them and replay them on your next fetch of the same URL. Works with a single URL or a batch.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Conditional requests are a stateless pass-through — Fetch does not store `etag` or `last_modified` for you. Save the values returned by `include_etag_and_last_modified` and replay them as `if_none_match` / `if_modified_since` on your next request to detect whether the page changed.
</Note>

<ParamField body="include_selectors" type="string[]">
  An array of CSS selectors (1–20 entries, each 1–1000 characters) that scopes extracted content (`text`, `links`, `image_links`) to elements matching **any** entry, concatenated in document order. Tag selectors cover semantic sections (`main`, `article`, `nav`); entries may themselves use CSS comma-grouping (`"main, footer"`). Standard CSS only — not XPath, Playwright `text=` locators, or glob patterns such as `*specificat*` (attribute matching like `[class*="price"]` is fine). Ids that start with a digit or contain dots are not valid `#id` selectors; use the attribute form instead (`[id="48599"]`).

  Selected content is returned verbatim, converted to the requested `format` (scripts and styles stripped) — automatic boilerplate removal is bypassed. Page-level metadata (`title`, `description`, `language`, `author`, `published_date`) still comes from the full document.

  If **some** entries match and others don't, the URL still succeeds with the matched content and the misses are listed in the result's `unmatched_selectors`. If **no** entry matches anything, that URL fails with the per-URL error code `selector_not_matched` — there is no silent full-page fallback — and the error carries `unmatched_selectors` plus `candidate_selectors` retry hints. Invalid CSS selector syntax is rejected with a `422`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="exclude_selectors" type="string[]">
  An array of CSS selectors (1–20 entries, each 1–1000 characters) for elements to remove before extraction. Applied **before** `include_selectors` scopes what remains, so it also prunes inside selected regions. Entries that match nothing are a no-op, never an error. Same syntax rules as `include_selectors`: standard CSS only, attribute form for digit-leading or dotted ids. Invalid CSS selector syntax is rejected with a `422`.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Selectors are applied after the page is fetched — caching and routing are unchanged. URLs that resolve to direct PDF or CSV downloads have no HTML to scope, so sending `include_selectors` or `exclude_selectors` for them fails that URL with `selector_unsupported`.
</Note>

<ParamField body="highlights" type="object">
  Ask a question and get back the passages from each page that best answer it — ranked, and quoted word-for-word from the page. Requires `format: "markdown"`. Sub-fields below.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="highlights.query" type="string" required>
  The question to answer from each page. Include the entity or topic in the query (e.g. "who founded Acme Corp", not "who founded this company") — retrieval works on vocabulary overlap with the page, and keyword-poor queries return empty results far more often.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="highlights.max_snippets" type="integer" default="5">
  Maximum ranked passages per URL. Between `1` and `20`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="highlights.max_characters" type="integer">
  Soft total-character budget across a URL's passages, between `100` and `20000`. Passages are added until the budget is reached, but the top-ranked passage is always returned even if it alone exceeds the budget.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="highlights.include_full_page_text" type="boolean" default="false">
  By default a highlights request returns just the passages — the result's `text` field is `null`. Set `true` to also receive the full page markdown in `text`.
</ParamField>

<Info>
  **Beta:** Highlights is in beta and is enabled per-account — contact support to enable it for your account. Requests that include `highlights` from an account that isn't enabled return `403 FORBIDDEN`; requests without the field are unaffected.
</Info>

<Note>
  Highlights are computed for standard web pages. PDFs and other non-HTML documents are still fetched and their text returned, but `highlights` is not computed for them — the field is absent on those results.
</Note>

## Response

```json theme={null}
{
  "results": [...],
  "errors": [...]
}
```

### `results[]`

One entry per successfully fetched URL.

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The original requested URL.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="final_url" type="string">
  The URL after any redirects. May differ from `url`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string | null">
  Page title, preferring `og:title` over `<title>`. `null` if not found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string | null">
  Meta description, preferring `og:description` over `<meta name="description">`. `null` if not found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="language" type="string | null">
  Detected page language (e.g. `"en"`). `null` if undetectable.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="author" type="string | null">
  Author from meta tags. `null` if not found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="published_date" type="string | null">
  Publication date, if detectable. `null` if not found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="text" type="string | object | null">
  Extracted page content. Format depends on the `format` request parameter:

  * `string` when `format` is `"html"` or `"markdown"`
  * `object` (document tree) when `format` is `"json"`
  * `null` on a highlights request, unless `highlights.include_full_page_text: true`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="links" type="string[]">
  All `<a href>` URLs on the page, resolved to absolute URLs. Only present when `links: true` was requested.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="image_links" type="string[]">
  All `<img src>` URLs on the page, resolved to absolute URLs. Only present when `image_links: true` was requested.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="iframe_links" type="string[]">
  `<iframe src>` URLs on the page, resolved to absolute URLs and deduplicated, in document order. Only present when `iframe_links: true` was requested.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="not_modified" type="boolean (optional)">
  Present and `true` only when the origin returned `304 Not Modified` for your `if_none_match` or `if_modified_since` header — the content is unchanged and you can skip re-processing. Omitted otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="etag" type="string (optional)">
  The origin's current ETag validator. Save it and replay it as `if_none_match` on your next fetch of this URL. Present only when the origin sent one and you set `include_etag_and_last_modified`; omitted otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="last_modified" type="string (optional)">
  The origin's current Last-Modified validator. Save it and replay it as `if_modified_since` on your next fetch of this URL. Present only when the origin sent one and you set `include_etag_and_last_modified`; omitted otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="unmatched_selectors" type="string[] (optional)">
  Partial-miss report for `include_selectors`: the entries that matched no elements on this page. Present only when some (but not all) entries matched — the result still carries the matched content. Omitted when every entry matched. A total miss is reported as a `selector_not_matched` entry in `errors[]` instead.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="highlights" type="object[] (optional)">
  Ranked verbatim passages answering the request's `highlights.query`, best first. Each entry is `{ "text": string, "rank": integer }`, with `rank` starting at `1`. Present only on highlights requests.

  An **empty array** means the page was fetched and analyzed and does not answer the query — a deliberate, calibrated signal, not a failure. A **missing field** on a highlights request means highlights could not be computed for this URL (rare and transient); the fetch itself still succeeded, and a retry is safe.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="latency_ms" type="number | null">
  Time to fetch and extract this URL, in milliseconds. `null` if unavailable.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="format" type="string">
  Output format used for the `text` field. Echoes the request `format` parameter (`"markdown"`, `"html"`, or `"json"`).
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  Fields that could not be extracted (`title`, `description`, `language`, `author`, `published_date`) are returned as `null`.
</Note>

### `errors[]`

One entry per URL that could not be fetched. Always present, may be empty. Per-URL failures do not affect the rest of the batch.

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The URL that failed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error" type="string">
  Structured error code identifying the failure type. One of: `target_http_error`, `page_not_found`, `target_unreachable`, `timeout`, `bot_blocked`, `empty_content`, `login_required`, `content_too_large`, `invalid_url`, `invalid_redirect_url`, `proxy_error`, `conditional_unsupported`, `selector_not_matched`, `selector_unsupported`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="number (optional)">
  Upstream HTTP status code. Present when `error` is `target_http_error` or `page_not_found`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="unmatched_selectors" type="string[] (optional)">
  The `include_selectors` entries that matched no elements on the fetched page. Present only when `error` is `selector_not_matched`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="candidate_selectors" type="string[] (optional)">
  Cheap retry hints (max 10), present only when `error` is `selector_not_matched`: landmark tags found on the page (e.g. `main`, `article`, `nav`) plus `#id` selectors of content-heavy elements. Agents can retry the fetch with `include_selectors` drawn from this list.
</ResponseField>

## Error Codes

HTTP-level errors apply to the entire request.

| Status | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `400` | Invalid request — missing `urls`, too many URLs (max 10), bad parameter value, `if_none_match`/`if_modified_since` combined with a batch of URLs, or `highlights` combined with a non-markdown `format` |
| `401` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `402` | Daily free allowance used and wallet balance is zero or below (`INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`) — add funds at the [wallet page](https://agent.tinyfish.ai/wallet) or wait for the daily reset. `FREE_ALLOWANCE_EXHAUSTED` when the allowance is used and the product does not charge the wallet (beta) — wait for the daily reset |
| `403` | `highlights` sent from an account that isn't beta-enabled — contact support for access |
| `422` | Invalid CSS selector syntax in `include_selectors` / `exclude_selectors` |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal server error |
| `503` | Fetch service or rate limiting unavailable — retry with backoff |

Per-URL errors appear in `errors[]` alongside a `200` response. The `error` field is one of these codes:

| Error code | `status` field | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| `target_http_error` | HTTP status code (e.g. `403`, `500`) | Target server returned a non-2xx HTTP response other than 404/410 |
| `page_not_found` | `404` or `410` | Target URL does not exist (HTTP 404 Not Found or 410 Gone) |
| `target_unreachable` | — | Connection refused, TLS failure, DNS failure, or other network error |
| `timeout` | — | Page did not finish loading within the request deadline |
| `bot_blocked` | — | Site returned a bot-protection challenge (Cloudflare, Incapsula) |
| `empty_content` | — | Browser returned HTML but no extractable text found |
| `login_required` | — | Target redirected to a login or account wall — the page is not served to anonymous sessions, so retrying without credentials won't help |
| `content_too_large` | — | Document exceeds the 20MB size limit for generic documents (PDF and CSV have their own 50MB budgets); not retried in the browser |
| `invalid_url` | — | URL rejected before fetch (private IP, invalid scheme, disallowed host) |
| `invalid_redirect_url` | — | Redirect target rejected before fetch (private IP or disallowed host) |
| `proxy_error` | — | Proxy tunnel failed — site may be reachable directly |
| `conditional_unsupported` | — | URL requires browser rendering — conditional requests (`if_none_match` / `if_modified_since`) are supported on the fast path only |
| `selector_not_matched` | — | No elements matching any `include_selectors` entry remained after `exclude_selectors` was applied (total miss); the error carries `unmatched_selectors` + `candidate_selectors` retry hints. A partial miss is not an error — it's reported on the result's `unmatched_selectors` |
| `selector_unsupported` | — | `include_selectors` / `exclude_selectors` sent for a URL that resolves to a direct PDF/CSV download — no HTML to scope |

<Note>
  Per-URL fetch failures are **not** HTTP errors. They appear as entries in `errors[]` alongside a `200` response.
</Note>

<Note>
  Each URL has a **110-second backend timeout**. If the page doesn't respond within 110 seconds, that URL returns a `timeout` error in `errors[]` while the rest of the batch continues. Requests are also subject to a **120-second CDN ceiling** for the full batch. Set your client-side timeout to at least **150 seconds** to receive CDN timeout errors cleanly.
</Note>

***

## Supported Content Types

| Content Type | Behavior |
| - | - |
| HTML | Full text extraction with formatting |
| PDF | Text content extracted |
| JSON | Raw JSON returned as text |
| Plain text | Full text returned |
| Images (PNG, JPG) | Not supported — returns an error indicating no extractable content |

***

***

## Rate Limits

Limits apply per API key, measured in URLs per minute across all requests. Accounts default to 150 URLs / minute. When the limit is exceeded, the API returns `HTTP 429`.

***

## Billing

Fetch is free up to 1,000 URLs per day, counted per successfully fetched URL; the allowance resets at 00:00 UTC. Beyond it, requests need a positive wallet balance: with a balance of zero or below the API returns `HTTP 402` with code `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` until you add funds or the allowance resets. After a top-up, allow a few seconds for the balance to apply. A product that does not charge the wallet (beta) returns `FREE_ALLOWANCE_EXHAUSTED` instead once its allowance is used; only the daily reset lifts it.
